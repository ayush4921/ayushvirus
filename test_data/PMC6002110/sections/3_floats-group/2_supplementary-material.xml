  <title>Phylogenetic analyses of Yellow fever virus (maximum likelihood).</title>
  <p>The tree was inferred using 60 Yellow fever virus sequences (1,038 nt) from South America, and the Maximum likelihood method implemented in PhyML 3.0. The nucleotide substitution model TN+G was used, and the approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) to access the support of branches (values are represented by circles drawn into scale at nodes). Yellow fever virus strains from South American Genotypes are shown in green, and the Brazilian yellow fever virus from outbreaks 2016â€“2018 are collapsed in a triangle. Horizontal branch lengths are drawn to a scale of nucleotide substituion per site according to the scale.</p>
