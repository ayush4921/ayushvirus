<p>In a similar way, the MRCAs of BR-YFV lineages that caused outbreaks in 2008–2009 and 2000–2001 were estimated to exist 1 to 2 years before their detection. The 2008–2009 outbreak took place in Midwest, South and Southeast regions of Brazil from 2008 onwards. However, the MRCA of these viruses was estimated to exist at 2007 (95%BCI = 2005–2008). This period coincides with the time that human cases were reported in the Midwest region in 2006, in the state of Mato Grosso (n = 1) and, shortly after, in 2007, in the state of Goiás (n = 2) [
