<p>In previous outbreaks, the numbers of human and NHP cases were considerably smaller than the current epidemic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The cause of the explosive character of the epidemics/epizootics in MG and neighbor states is still unclear, but the silent circulation of YFV might have contributed to the geographic dissemination until the epidemic seasons started (2016–2017 and 2017–2018). These facts added to the vaccination coverage [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] which was very low in some regions of MG (including the regions where the outbreaks took place), until 2016 might have contributed to the magnitude of this ongoing YF epidemic. Moreover, genome sequences have revealed mutations leading to amino acid substitutions constituting synapomorphies of lineage BR-YFV_2016/18, in the capsid and in non-structural proteins [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, this is still an open debate, and further studies should be conducted to better understand the dynamics of the current YF epidemics, in the light of virological, ecological, evolutionary, immunological, and epidemiological aspects.
