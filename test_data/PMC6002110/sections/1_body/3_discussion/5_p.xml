<p>The MRCA of lineages BR-YFV_2016/18 and BR-YFV_2008/09 were dated in a period when SYF was reported in the Midwest region. These facts support the hypothesis that YFV causing those outbreaks (2016–18, and 2008–09) would have been originated in the Midwest region. In fact, Brazilian health authorities already postulated that the detection of YFV in the Midwest region should be fully addressed with the intensification of viral surveillance [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], epidemiological records combined with the evolutionary data presented here, support the idea that the Midwest region may be a hot spot for YFV emerging outside the Amazon Basin.
