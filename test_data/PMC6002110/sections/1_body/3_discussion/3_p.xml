<p>The MRCA of lineage BR-YFV_2016/18 was estimated to exist in a period (middle of 2015, 95% BCI = from July 2014 to January 2016) that was coincident to YFV reemergence and circulation in the Midwest region. In July 2014, SYF reemerged in the Midwest region (state of Goiás) and, based on temporal and spatial epidemiological data, the virus disseminated and reached the Southeast region (SP state), in 2016 [
