<p>Finally, the results support a single introduction of YFV in the Southeast region, approximately in 2015, and viral persistence and local evolution until 2018. This is particularly worrisome as the Southeast region concentrates 44.7% of the Brazilian population and it is classified as an area of high receptivity to YF transmission. Yellow fever surveillance, including human, sentinel animals and entomological surveillance, coupled with studies on viral dynamics deserve particular attention in Brazil, mainly in Southeast, Midwest and adjacent regions.</p>
