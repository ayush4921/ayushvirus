<p>BR-YFVs obtained from 2016 to 2018 from SP, MG and Espírito Santo states clustered within lineage BR-YFV_2016/18, sharing a common ancestor estimated to exist in the middle of 2015. Moreover, this lineage has persisted from this time up to 2018, infecting humans and NHPs in the Southeast region. This lineage was closely related to strains from Venezuela, and in fact, some studies have proposed that YFV causing the recent outbreak was probably introduced into Brazil, from Venezuela [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, there are very few nt sequences of BR-YFV from previous years (obtained at different times and geographic regions) making the phylogeographic analyses to test this hypothesis difficult. Combining our results with epidemiological records (date and place where previous cases of human YF and epizootics took place in Brazil), we obtained some insights about the origin of YFV outbreaks outside the Amazon Basin, in Brazil.
