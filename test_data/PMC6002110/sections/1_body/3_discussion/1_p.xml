<p>Here we aimed to decipher the origin of the YFV responsible for more than 593 deaths in Brazil, from 2016 to April 2018. For this purpose, we performed molecular analyses of BR-YFV associated with human epidemics and epizootics in NHPs. Nucleotide sequences of 16 BR-YFVs were highly conserved and formed a monophyletic lineage called BR-YFV_2016/18, confirming a single event of introduction of YFV in the Southeast region, causing the ongoing outbreak. After the introduction in the Southeast region, this lineage has been locally evolving, giving rise to different subgroups. Previous findings, based on analysis of BR-YFVs obtained in 2017, from states of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Esp√≠rito Santo [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], support this conclusion. Within the lineage BR-YFV_2016/18, we observed one cluster composed by YFVs from human and different species of NHPs, indicating the sylvatic transmission during the outbreaks, as previously demonstrated [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another cluster which presented two synapomorphies (two amino acid substitutions in the deduced envelope protein), grouped YFV strains associated with NHPs. These synapomorphies were not associated with any NHP genera as they were observed in specimens obtained from

 <italic>Callithrix</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Callicebus</italic> sp. Moreira-Soto and colleagues (2018) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] also observed the presence of a basal YFV group (from 2017) associated with NHPs. These data may indicate the existence of a cluster within lineage BR-YFV_2016/18 only associated with epizootics in NHPs, but a greater number of strains from human and NHPs should be analyzed to test this hypothesis.
