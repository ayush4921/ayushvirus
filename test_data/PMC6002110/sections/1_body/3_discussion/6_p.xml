<p>The gap (1 to 2 years) between the date of MRCAs of BR-YFV lineages (BR-YFV_2000/01, BR-YFV_2008/09, and BR-YFV_2016/18) and the detection of SYV demonstrate that YFV is maintained in a silent circulation outside the Amazon Basin, for a period before its detection. Here, we showed the introduction of YFV, followed by its persistence in the Southeast region, for more than 3 years. Recent outbreaks in Brazil also confirmed the intense YFV circulation during epidemic periods [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] in Southeast and Midwest regions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These data suggest that areas outside the Amazon Basin present suitable ecological and climatic conditions for YFV maintenance, even during interepidemic periods. In fact, based on the records of YF infection and vaccination coverage, Shearer and colleagues (2018) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] identified the Southeast coast of Brazil (states of Bahia, MG, SP, Esp√≠rito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro) as an area of high receptivity to YFV transmission.
