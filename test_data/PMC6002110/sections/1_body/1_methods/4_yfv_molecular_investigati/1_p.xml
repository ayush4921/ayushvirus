<p>For each NHP (n = 10), fragments of 30 mg of the liver were used in total RNA extraction, using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA). From human samples, total RNA was extracted using 140 Î¼L of serum (n = 3, sera collected in 2018) or infected cell supernatant (n = 3, sera collected in 2017), using QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA). YFV RNA investigation was performed by real-time PCR preceded by reverse transcription (RT-qPCR), using GoTaq Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR System (Promega) and primers and probe described by Domingo and colleagues (2012) [
