<p>Based on the availability of BR-YFV sequences in databases, in February 2018, we worked with two datasets, containing sequences from CprM/envelope region and used these datasets for phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses. The first dataset included 60 YFV nucleotide (nt) sequences, spanning 1,038 nt (from the nt 125 to 1,162 of ES504 (KY885000) sequence), from South America and African genotypes. The first dataset included 22 sequences of BR-YFV obtained from 2016 to 2018 plus 13 sequences of BR-YFV from previous years (BR-YFV sequences: n = 35) (

To include a greater number of sequences from Latin America and Brazil, we performed the analyses with a second dataset, using a different part of CprM/envelope region (n = 125 sequences, 651 nt, nt 644 to 1,294 of ES504 (KY885000) sequence). This second dataset included 18 sequences of BR-YFV obtained in 2017 and 2018 plus 57 sequences of BR-YFV from previous years (BR-YFV sequences: n = 75) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006538.s007">S4 Table</xref>). The nt sequences were aligned with MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the alignments were used to perform evolutionary analyses. Phylogenetic trees using the Maximum likelihood method implemented in PhyML 3.0 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were reconstructed. The nucleotide substitution model TN+G was selected using SMS [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and for tree search the SPR branch-swapping algorithm was used followed by the approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) to access the support of branches. Analyses to check temporal signal of sequences were performed using TempEst v.1.5.1 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], previously to analyses to infer the time of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of YFV causing the outbreaks in 2000–01, 2008–09, and the current one (2016–2018). Analyses were performed using BEAST package v.1.8.4 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Input files for BEAST v.1.8.4 were created with BEAUTi v.1.8.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The calibration point was the year in which each virus was obtained. Runs were performed using the different demographic coalescent models (parametric and non-parametric) under strict or relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and using the estimated rate of 5×10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per site [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The best model was selected comparing the marginal likelihood estimations, using path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) methods [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The estimates were performed nucleotide substitution model HKY, with gamma distribution (four categories), under the relaxed molecular clock and Bayesian skyline demographic model. One hundred million chains were run, the first 10 million steps were discarded, convergence of parameters was verified with Tracer v.1.5.0 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and uncertainties were addressed as the 95% Bayesian credible intervals (BCI). The trees were sampled at every 10,000 steps and then summarized in a maximum clade credibility tree using TreeAnotator v.1.8.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Chains were run for three independent times and data were combined using LogCombiner v.1.7.4 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The final tree was visualized in FigTree v.1.4.3 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006538.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
