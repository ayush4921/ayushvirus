<p>Using dataset 1 containing 22 sequences of BR-YFVs from 2016 to 2018, the MRCA of lineage BR-YFV_2016/18 was estimated at July 2015 (95% Bayesian credible intervals (95%BCI) = from July 2014 to January 2016). The MRCA of BR-YFVs from 2017 and 2018 was estimated to exist in May 2016 (95%BCI = from July 2015 to January 2017). For estimation of MRCA of older BR-YFV lineages, we used the second dataset that contained more YFV sequences from previous outbreaks. The lineage BR-YFV_2008/09 had the MRCA dated at 2007 (95%BCI = from 2005 to 2008), and the MRCA of lineage BR-YFV_2000/01 was estimated to exist in the middle of 1998 (95%BCI = from 1997 to 1999).</p>
