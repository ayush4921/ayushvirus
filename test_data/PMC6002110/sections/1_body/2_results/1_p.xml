<p>All human (n = 6) and NHP (n = 10) samples tested positive by RT-qPCR, confirming the infection by YFV. YFV nt sequences (n = 16) spanning 1,259 nt from capsid to envelope region were obtained (Genbank accession numbers: MG838679—MG838688, MH001693—MH001695 and MH015342-MH015344). Sequences of YFV collected in 2017 and 2018 were highly conserved (99.8–100% of nt identity). In some of the predicted amino acid sequences of BR-YFV obtained from NHPs, two mutations were observed in the envelope gene sequence, which resulted in two amino acid substitution in positions 15 (V to L), and 16 (H to Y).</p>
