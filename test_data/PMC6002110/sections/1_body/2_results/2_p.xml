 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006538.g001">Fig 1</xref>) demonstrated that BR-YFVs from 2016 to 2018, formed a monophyletic lineage, called BR-YFV_2016/18 (supported by a posterior probability (PP) equal to 1). This lineage clustered within South America genotype I. Using the second dataset, BR-YFVs from 2017 and 2018, also formed a monophyletic cluster highly supported (PP = 1) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006538.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). BR-YFVs within the lineage BR-YFV_2016–18 were closely related to YFV from Venezuela (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006538.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). BR-YFVs from outbreaks that took place in 2000–01 (Midwest, and Southeast regions) and 2008–09 (Midwest, South, and Southeast regions) formed distinct lineages (PP&gt;0.91), called here lineages BR-YFV_2000/01 and BR-YFV_2008/09, respectively) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006538.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The monophyletic lineage BR-YFV_2016/18 was subdivided into different clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006538.g001">Fig 1</xref>) with YFV from 2016 in a basal position within the lineage. One cluster contained BR-YFV (obtained from five NHPs, from genera 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Callicebus</italic> sp.), presenting two synapomorphies regarding the amino acid substitutions in positions 15 and 16 of deduced envelope protein. Another cluster contained BR-YFVs, from 2017 and 2018, obtained from NHPs (
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Callicebus</italic> sp.) and humans (
