 <p>We use a unique combination of large-scale laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance and genomic sequence data to determine the pattern and determinants of influenza spread through time and space at a continental scale, utilizing 450,000 data entries gathered across Australia over a 10-year period (2007â€“2016). Our results reveal a remarkable epidemiological synchronicity across this large and geographically diverse continent, and in the face of enormous climatic variation, from the tropical north to the temperate south. Such synchronicity was especially marked during years associated with the emergence of antigenically distinct strains. This pattern of continental synchronicity highlights the importance of a highly coordinated responses in the event of the emergence of a novel, human-to-human transmissible, virus, and hence has broad-scale public health implications.</p>
