  <title>The normalized measure of pairwise synchrony in epidemic onset times between pairs of locations as a function of distance (kilometers).</title>
  <p>Values near zero indicate that epidemics start close together in time, while values near -1 and 1 indicate a lag in onset times. Each circle illustrates the mean pairwise synchrony for pairs within 1 kilometer and the shaded area represents the 95% percentile for the mean. Only years 2009â€“2016 are shown since these years had larger and more consistent sampling across all locations. Grey vertical bars mark the pairwise distances between the major cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, in the order shown in
