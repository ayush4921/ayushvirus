  <title>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of global influenza virus.</title>
  <p>All available HA genetic sequences were downloaded from the GISAID EpiFlu database (platform.gisaid.org) for the following years and subtypes: (i) 2009 H1N1 (n = 10,016); (ii) 2014 H3N2 (n = 5,584); and (iii) 2015 Influenza B (n = 3,882). Sequences that were isolated from Australia are highlighted in red. More detailed analysis of patterns of spread within Australia are shown in
