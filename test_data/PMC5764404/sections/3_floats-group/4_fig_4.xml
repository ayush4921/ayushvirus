   <bold>(A)</bold> Latitude (degrees) as a function of epidemic onset time, showing only epidemics from postcodes located &gt;145° longitude and hence covering the bulk of the Australian population. Pearson’s correlation coefficient is noted for each year, and an asterisk denotes 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Boxplots of increasing population density within postcodes (people per square kilometer) and timing of the epidemic in that postcode. The x-axis gives quartiles of the densities, which ranged from 0.002 people per km
   <sup>2</sup> to 12,877 people per km
   <sup>2</sup>. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The distance (km) from nearest airport as a function of epidemic onset time. Data points are colored by the total number of domestic passengers per year (see color bar).
