   <bold>(A)</bold> Maps show the proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A compared to influenza B between 2007â€“2016 for each Australian postal area corresponding to the adjacent color scale (i.e. blue: influenza B and yellow: influenza A). A colored box indicates the year, where the color denotes the overall national-level mean proportion for that year. Any deviation from this proportion suggests that influenza A and B were occupying different spatial regions. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> (i) proportional time series of influenza A and influenza B cases; (ii) the number of laboratory-confirmed cases per week (left axis: influenza B; right axis: influenza A); and (iii) de-seasonalized number of laboratory confirmed cases, now showing only long-term trends and the noise components (left axis: influenza B; right axis: influenza A). For seasonal smoothing, data were de-trended and a stable seasonal filter was applied and subtracted from the time series data.
