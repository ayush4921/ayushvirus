<p>Seasonal and pandemic influenza remains one of the most important infectious diseases of humans and is associated with high levels of both morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Influenza epidemics occur annually due to the continual accumulation of small changes in surface antigens of influenza virus that escape host immunity and hence allow reinfection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. At present, four different forms of influenza virus co-circulate in human populations: the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A virus and the Victoria and Yamagata lineages of influenza B virus. Influenza-related mortality is highest in years when A/H3N2 viruses dominate, the rapid evolution of which also leads to the frequent emergence of antigenically distinct variants [
