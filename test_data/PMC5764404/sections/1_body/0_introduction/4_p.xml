<p>The national and international spread of influenza virus is clearly complex, with the onset, duration and disease severity being largely dependent on the circulating virus strains, population immunity, human mobility and climatic factors. However, teasing apart the individual contributions of these factors has proven difficult, particularly given the diagnostic uncertainty associated with ILI data. Quantifying the spatiotemporal spread of influenza virus is particularly important for identifying the factors that contribute to its epidemic spread and for the precise targeting of control interventions. Here, we utilize large-scale laboratory-confirmed influenza incidence data collected by the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS;

In particular, we sought to reveal the extent of epidemiological synchronicity within such a large and geographically diverse country, and what this means for understanding the determinants of influenza spread.
