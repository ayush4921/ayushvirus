<p>The island continent of Australia offers a unique and opposing exploration of influenza dissemination. Australia’s human population is geographically concentrated in urban centers within two widely separated coastal regions that span over 4,000 kilometers. Hence, Australia is simultaneously one of the world’s most highly urbanized populations and least densely populated countries. The continent spans tropical to temperate latitudes and experiences highly variable climatic conditions. Human populations in temperate regions of Australia generally experience seasonal outbreaks of influenza infection between May and October [
