<p>Influenza in temperate regions is characterized by an annual winter epidemic, whereas tropical regions experience less distinct annual patterns with sporadic outbreaks throughout the year [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Defining the seasonal and climatic drivers of influenza virus in both temperate and tropical regions has proven problematic and been the focus of much recent research [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, a detailed characterization of the spread of influenza virus through time and space at the scale of individual countries and/or continents has been hindered by the lack of spatially refined incidence data. Indeed, our understanding of influenza transmission has relied heavily on observations of influenza-like illness (ILI). Unfortunately, the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of influenza based on ILI alone is limited due to the considerable overlap of symptoms caused by other respiratory pathogens [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], with influenza virus reported to cause as few as 29% of all ILI infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, the detailed analysis of ILI data from the United States has shown that the nationwide spatial transmission of influenza virus is principally driven by workflow commuting [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Much of this work suggests a high geographical correlation of influenza epidemics both at a local level in the United States [
