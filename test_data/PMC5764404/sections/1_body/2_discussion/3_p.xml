We found that the time from the 5

 <sup>th</sup> percentile of locations to be infected was less than 10 weeks in 2009, compared to an average time of ~25 weeks for the other years studied here. In Australia, up to 65% of ILI clinical isolates tested positive for influenza A and by early July 2009, A/H1N1 accounted for 90% of influenza A isolates [
