<p>Influenza seasons in 2012, 2014 and 2016 were also characterized by highly synchronous epidemics and were dominated by A/H3N2 viruses, and often associated with distinct antigenic changes. Specifically, 2012 saw the emergence of A/Victoria/361/2011-A/Texas/50/2012-like viruses (3C.1 clade), and in 2014 the emergence and co-circulation of three genetically distinct viral clades; the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like viruses (also referred to as 3C.2a clade), A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like viruses (3C.3a) and A/Newcastle/22/2014-like viruses (3C.3b). Following both influenza seasons, there was a change in the H3 vaccine recommendation for the following year (2013 SH vaccine: A/Victoria/361/2011-like virus and for 2015 SH vaccine: A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like virus) [

Although no major antigenic changes were detected that were distinct from the Hong Kong/4801/2014-like viruses that had circulated in 2015, 2015 was dominated by influenza B such that relatively few A/H3N2 cases were detected compared to previous years. Consequently, the population was less exposed to A/H3N2 during 2015, likely leading to lower levels of population immunity in years immediately following.
