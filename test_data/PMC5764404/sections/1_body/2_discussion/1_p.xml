<p>We examined the spatial and temporal spread of influenza viruses in Australia over ten years between 2007â€“2016 using a unique data set of spatially refined laboratory-confirmed influenza cases that comprises &gt;450,000 entries. While many studies of the spatial spread of influenza are based on ILI data, in which accuracy is often highly variable and not well measured, our data set offers a rare opportunity to study laboratory-confirmed influenza (based mostly on real-time PCR testing). We focused on the onset time of established epidemics in each postal region (by postcode) across Australia in which data were reported. Importantly, establishment of an epidemic requires sustained transmission compared to a baseline number of cases, because the number of cases at baseline may not necessarily be associated with a transmission event leading to an epidemic. Detection of established epidemics was therefore reliant on virus outbreaks
