<p>The apparent lack of radial virus dispersal observed in Australia also suggests that short-range commuter transmission has not played a major role in epidemic spread, or that it cannot be resolved in the scale of the data analyzed here. This sits in marked contrast to previous studies of more homogeneously-populated countries such as the United States, in which the analysis of ILI data revealed that virus dispersal was predominantly localized with distinct radial patterns from an infected location, with the estimated risk of transmission decreasing sharply with geographic distance [

Although it is possible that some of this difference reflects underlying differences in the data collected (i.e. laboratory-confirmed influenza versus ILI), the degree of synchronicity that we have observed during novel antigenic influenza seasons supports continued highly coordinated public health responses across Australiaâ€™s populous cities in the event of the emergence of a novel, directly transmissible, virus. Accordingly, in light of the speed with which novel viruses spread, the most populous cities experience synchronized epidemics, likely to be driven by strong domestic connectedness and international travel. These observations may be used to inform prospective pandemic planning efforts both in Australia and likely in other highly urbanized localities.
