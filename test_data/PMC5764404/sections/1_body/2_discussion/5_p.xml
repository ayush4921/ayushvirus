<p>We found a distinct lack of radial spread from the first point of virus entry; instead, populous cities tended to have well-synchronized epidemics. While data on work flow patterns in Australia were unavailable for this study, this national synchrony suggests that transmission patterns driven by work flow may have played a relatively minor role in influenza epidemic spread. Rather, these synchronized epidemics across Australian cities suggest rapid dissemination either through domestic flight traffic and/or by multiple global introductions. Indeed, our phylogeographic analysis of global influenza gene sequence data from key years shows that there have been multiple introductions of influenza into Australia annually, which were then able to establish transmission chains across the country, similar to that seen in other localities [

These continual introductions from the global population are emphasized by the relatively small number of clades exclusively comprised of Australian isolates. Overall, this pattern again highlights the fluidity with which influenza viruses spread both nationally and globally [
