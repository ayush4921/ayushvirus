<p>We next analyzed the time series of each influenza virus. These displayed a strong seasonal signature and an average annual peak at week ~34 (i.e. mid-August) for both influenza A and B, but was delayed in 2010 until week 39 for both viruses, likely due to the large-scale A/H1N1 outbreak during 2009. We also investigated the possibility of cross-protective immunity among influenza A and B by analyzing the time series in more detail (

This reveals that, on occasion, there is a single dominant type annual peak during a seasonal cycle, again compatible with moderate cross-protective immunity or possibly residual immunity from previous seasons infection or vaccination.
