<p>We examined the number of cases of influenza A and B, the most common influenza viruses in the data set, over the ten-year sampling time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006780.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Influenza C was not examined because of the small number of cases reported reflecting the fact that few laboratories in Australia currently test for influenza C. Maps show that the proportion of influenza A compared to influenza B varied each year between 2007â€“2016. As expected, very few influenza B cases were reported during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, while in other years more locations reported higher proportions of influenza B cases. Influenza B dominated in 2015 with 60% of the total influenza cases, while only 39% were influenza A and the remaining cases were mixed infections of A and B. In all other years, influenza A was the dominant virus. During 2012, influenza A cases were concentrated in the southeast of Australia, while influenza B cases were largely concentrated in northern and western regions. While the majority of seasons displayed a co-circulation of influenza A and B, these two virus types often occupied and dominated different postcodes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006780.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). It is important to note, however, that many remote postcodes often reported very few cases each year, such that these patterns may be a reflection of low sample sizes in these locations. Despite this caveat, this spatial pattern might indicate that while one virus dominated in a particular geographic region, the other virus may have failed to establish, perhaps indicative of moderate cross-protective immunity or interference caused by the first establishing virus.
