<p>The data set included the number of influenza cases per day between 2006 and 2016, by age group and virus type/subtype (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006780.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). The majority (75%) of viruses were influenza A virus; however, in 70% of these cases the subtype was unspecified, with the remaining influenza A cases defined as H3N2 (8%) and H1N1 (22%). The number of un-subtyped influenza A virus cases varied among years. For this reason, we necessarily considered all influenza A cases in the main analysis as a single group rather than considering individual influenza A virus subtypes. Other viruses isolated included: A and B (0.01%); B (25%); C (0.0007%); and unknown (0.002%) cases. Data included the five-year age group of patients, which ranged from 0 to 85+ years old. In all years, the age group reporting the highest number of cases was the 0–4 year old group, with the exception of 2009 and 2015 in which the highest number of cases were reported from the 10–14 year old and 5–9 year old groups, respectively. Since data collection increased markedly from 2007 onwards, cases in 2006 and prior were excluded from further analysis.
