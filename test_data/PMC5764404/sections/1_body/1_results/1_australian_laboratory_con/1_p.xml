<p>The data provided by the Australian NNDSS are characterized by both spatial and temporal richness. The data set includes date of diagnosis, postcode of residence at the time of the test and, in the vast majority (98%) of cases, the influenza virus type detected. Although the overall aim for this surveillance is for complete case ascertainment, there are clearly some caveats in that only those cases for which health care was sought and a laboratory test conducted were represented. Nevertheless, this is one of the most well defined laboratory-confirmed influenza data sets at a nationwide level currently available globally.</p>
