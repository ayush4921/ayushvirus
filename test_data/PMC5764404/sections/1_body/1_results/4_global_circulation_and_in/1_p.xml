<p>To determine the relationship of those influenza viruses present in Australia and those circulating globally, we inferred phylogenetic trees for three subtypes over key years: (i) influenza A H1N1 during 2009; (ii) influenza A H3N2 during 2014; and (iii) influenza B during 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006780.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Because of their relatively large data sets, we utilized global hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequence data comprising 19,482 sequences and analyzed the phylogeographic patterns present in the data, particularly the positions of the Australian sequences. For each of these influenza seasons there was little clustering of Australian sequences. Indeed, Australian sequences were dispersed across all the phylogenies, indicating multiple introductions into Australia from the global population as is common in other localities [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, the 224 Australian sequences available from the outbreak of H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009 fell into 41 phylogenetically distinct clusters or single lineages. The largest clades comprising Australian-only sequences were (i) H1N1, 2009 = 52 (of 224 (23%) Australian samples); (ii) H3N2, 2014 = 23 (of 196 (12%) Australian samples); and (iii) influenza B, 2015 = 30 (of 164 (18%) Australian samples). In addition, these Australian clades were sampled from many different locations within Australia, highlighting the importance of virus spread within Australia (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, in 2014, A/H3N2 appears to enter the state of Victoria and from this location spreads to both the east (i.e. Sydney, Brisbane and Newcastle) and the west (i.e. Perth) coasts (
