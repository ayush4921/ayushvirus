<p>There were no obvious radial patterns of virus dispersal from the location of the first outbreak each year. Rather, it was striking that epidemic onset was largely synchronized in the major cities, particularly during 2009 (

This result suggests dissemination of influenza through long-distance domestic air travel, likely coupled with multiple entries of influenza into Australia within a short period of time. We also found that onset timing of influenza A and B epidemics occurred around the same time each year, with the exception of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic season. In 2009, the mean epidemic onset timing of influenza B was week ~7 due to a few sporadic, inter-seasonal cases that preceded the emergence and takeover of the pandemic A/H1N1 (
