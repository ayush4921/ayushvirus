<p>We next estimated the timing of epidemic onset of influenza in Australia. To this end we first compared epidemic onset timing, which corresponds to the breakpoint in the piecewise regression, of influenza A across ten years from 2007â€“2016 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006780.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This comprised fitting linear regressions to the number of cases as a function of time, where the break-point marked the change in the slope of the line. Overall, the timing of the nationwide epidemic onset ranged from week 20.6 in 2009 to week 30.9 in 2010.
