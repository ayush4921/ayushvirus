<p>During 2013 and 2016 there was a significant negative correlation between epidemic onset time and latitude; hence, northern regions experienced outbreaks that were, on average, earlier than southern regions (

Overall, our analysis revealed that latitude was a poor predictor of epidemic onset time, and there was no consistent association even with those postcodes located along Australia’s east coast (i.e. &gt;145° longitude), where most of the human population resides. Only in 2009 and 2012 did the onset of epidemics in southern latitudes precede those in northern latitudes (
