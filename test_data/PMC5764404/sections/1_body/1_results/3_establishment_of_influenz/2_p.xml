<p>To determine whether the timing of influenza outbreaks varied across Australia, we also estimated the epidemic onset timing for each sampling location. Estimation of epidemic onset timing required an established virus outbreak above baseline and is hence reliant on the strength of the influenza signal in each location. The total number of locations with established epidemics was therefore only a fraction of those locations with reported influenza cases, and ranged from 53 locations in 2008 to 679 locations in 2016 (

In 2010, however, the first established outbreak was observed on Thursday Island in far north Queensland in the second week of January. Australia, which covers climatically diverse latitudes, often experiences sporadic yet sustained inter-seasonal outbreaks that have been shown to persist in tropical and sub-tropical regions [
