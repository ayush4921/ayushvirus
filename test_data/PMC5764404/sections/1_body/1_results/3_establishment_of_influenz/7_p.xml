<p>To determine the role of distance on the spatial spread of influenza in Australia, we investigated the difference in onset timing between pairs of locations and their pairwise distance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006780.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Spatial synchrony of epidemic onset timing was highly variable. In 2009, all locations experienced epidemic onset around the same time at, on average, week 23 with an interquartile range of week 21–26, suggesting very strong synchrony. In addition, epidemics were overall well-synchronized in 2012, 2014 and 2016 (all A/H3N2 dominant years) compared to other years. Importantly, epidemic onset timing was not correlated with geographic distance. In fact, the furthest points tended to display synchrony in onset timing suggesting that influenza reached both coastal extremes of Australia at approximately the same time. For example, across all years sampled, there was no significant difference in epidemic onset timing between Sydney and Perth, which are separated by a distance of 3,300 kilometers. In addition, points that fall on the grey vertical bars seem to be close to zero, meaning that there is little difference in onset time between pairwise locations. Although there appears to be a synchrony break at about 1750–2000 km, this reflects the fact that there are few populous postcodes that have this range of pairwise distances. Overall, these results suggest a highly synchronized epidemic onset timing within the most populous Australian cities that may be enhanced during years with antigenic novelty.
