<p>To help reveal the determinants of influenza spread, we next investigated the role of population density and volume of air traffic between Australiaâ€™s domestic airports on the timing of epidemic onset. This revealed that there was no association between population density per postcode and the onset of epidemics (

Similarly, we found no linear relationship between the distance to the nearest domestic airport and the epidemic onset in a given postcode. Although the timing of epidemics was more clustered (i.e. synchronized) at postcodes close to airports with a higher number of domestic passengers (
