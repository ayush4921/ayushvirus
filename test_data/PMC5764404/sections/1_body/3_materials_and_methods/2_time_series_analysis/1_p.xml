<p>We first analyzed the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases of influenza viruses A and B to determine the dominant viruses present in Australia between 2007–2016. All cases specified as influenza A and B were included in this analysis. Only 33% of influenza A notifications included the subtype (i.e. A/H1N1 or A/H3N2), precluding further analysis by subtype. Since ‘diagnosis date’ might represent the time from the onset of symptoms or the date at which the specimen was collected, we aggregated the data by the number of cases per week and thus considered the weekly time series of these laboratory-confirmed cases. We explored both the proportion and number of cases of each virus across Australia. For seasonal smoothing, data were de-trended and a stable seasonal filter was applied and subtracted from the time series data (using Matlab v.2016b). By removing the seasonality of the time series, only the long-term trends and the noise components of the data were exposed.</p>
