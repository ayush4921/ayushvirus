<p>To further investigate the introduction and subsequent spatial spread of influenza virus in Australia, particularly the number of introductions in any one influenza season and the presence of Australia-specific clades, we estimated the phylogenetic relationships of influenza virus A and B on a global scale. For this we utilized global gene sequence data available from the GISAID EpiFlu database (platform.gisaid.org) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (note that these data are unlinked to the influenza incidence data analyzed here). All available HA genetic sequences, with a minimum length of 500 nucleotides, were downloaded for years in which global influenza data were abundant: (i) 2009 H1N1 (n = 10,016); (ii) 2014 H3N2 (n = 5,584); and (iii) 2015 influenza B virus (n = 3,882). Each sequence data set was aligned using the multiple-sequence alignment method available in the MAFFT program, using the FFT-NS-1 strategy [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], applying the general time reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model with a gamma (Î“) distribution of among-site rate variation. Support for individual nodes was assessed using a bootstrap procedure with 100 replicates and phylogenetic trees were annotated in FigTree (v1.4.3).
