<p>Laboratory-confirmed influenza is a notifiable disease in Australia, with notifications made by health care professionals and laboratories to jurisdictional health departments. The data set included 454,800 entries from 2,510 distinct postal areas, collected between 1
 <sup>st</sup> January 2006 and 31
 <sup>st</sup> December 2016. These entries included the patient’s age (within a five-year age group) and, in 98% of cases, the influenza virus type (i.e. A, B or C) detected. The ‘diagnosis date’ represented either the onset date or, where the date of onset was not known, the specimen collection date or the notification date. Data collected in 2006 were excluded from further analysis since data collection in all locations became more consistent from 2007. This left a final data set size of 451,480 entries spanning ten years collected between 2007 and 2016.
