<p>Next, we performed additional quantitative analyses of the strength of association between particular socio-economic parameters and epidemic onset timing. First, we investigated the role of population density within postcodes and the timing of epidemic onset. Accordingly, population size per postcode (taken from the 2016 Australian census data available at

Second, to explore the association between the extent of air travel and epidemic onset, we calculated the number of domestic passengers on inbound and outbound flights from the busiest 96 airports in Australia (data obtained from
