<p>We estimated the ‘epidemic onset timing’, defined as the timing of the break-point in influenza incidence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], across the ten-year period for which sufficient incidence data were available (i.e. 2007–2016). For each year, we therefore fitted piecewise linear models to determine the break-point in influenza incidence using the 
 <italic>Segmented</italic> package in R [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006780.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Importantly, the break-point represents the time at which an epidemic can be considered established–in other words, the time of epidemic onset–rather than the time at which the virus first entered Australia each year. The establishment of an epidemic requires the sustained transmission of influenza, whereas an introduction simply represents the first case of influenza each year regardless of whether that first introduction triggered an outbreak. To this end, the onset timing of all influenza A (regardless of subtype) epidemics for each year was determined since these represented the majority of cases in the data set.
