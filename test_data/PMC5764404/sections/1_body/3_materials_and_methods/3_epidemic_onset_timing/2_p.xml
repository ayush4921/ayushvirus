<p>With these data in hand we aimed to better understand the spatial and temporal spread of influenza in Australia. To this end we estimated the epidemic onset timing in each postcode area for all cases of influenza A between 2007â€“2016. We investigated the synchrony of epidemic onset timing between pairs of locations and their pairwise geographical distance within a 1 kilometer range. Finally, we compared the epidemic onset timing between major cities in Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Townsville, Darwin, Hobart and Perth), and between laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B viruses.</p>
